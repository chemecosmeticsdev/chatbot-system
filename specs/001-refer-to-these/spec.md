## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an administrator of a chatbot management system, I need to create, configure, and deploy intelligent chatbots that can answer customer questions using my organization's knowledge base. The system should support multiple languages (Thai/English), allow me to upload and process documents, train multiple chatbot instances with different personalities and knowledge scopes, integrate with messaging platforms like Line OA, and provide analytics to monitor performance and improve responses over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Knowledge Base Management
1. **Given** I have PDF documents containing product information, **When** I upload them to the system, **Then** the documents are processed, text is extracted, and content is made searchable for chatbot responses
2. **Given** I have configured web crawling for an e-commerce site, **When** the crawling job runs, **Then** new products are automatically detected, categorized, and added to the knowledge base
3. **Given** I have uploaded multiple documents, **When** I view the knowledge base, **Then** I can see the hierarchical relationship between products and their associated documents

#### Chatbot Instance Management
4. **Given** I want to create a customer support chatbot, **When** I use the chatbot creation wizard, **Then** I can configure the chatbot's name, personality, knowledge scope, and AI model preferences
5. **Given** I have multiple chatbot instances, **When** I assign different knowledge bases to each, **Then** each chatbot only responds with information relevant to its assigned scope
6. **Given** I provide natural language feedback about a chatbot's response, **When** the system processes my feedback, **Then** it generates improved system prompts that enhance the chatbot's future responses

#### Integration and Deployment
7. **Given** I want to integrate my chatbot with Line OA, **When** I configure the Line credentials, **Then** users can interact with my chatbot through the Line messaging platform
8. **Given** I want to embed my chatbot on a website, **When** I generate embed code, **Then** I receive customizable iframe or JavaScript widget code for integration
9. **Given** I want to test my chatbot before deployment, **When** I use the playground interface, **Then** I can interact with the chatbot and see detailed response information including sources and confidence scores

#### Analytics and Monitoring
10. **Given** my chatbots are active and handling conversations, **When** I view the analytics dashboard, **Then** I can see conversation volume, user satisfaction, response accuracy, and cost metrics
11. **Given** I want to improve chatbot performance, **When** I review conversation history, **Then** I can identify common query patterns and areas where responses could be improved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a document upload fails during processing?
- How does the system handle when a chatbot cannot find relevant information to answer a user's question?
- What occurs when multiple administrators try to modify the same chatbot configuration simultaneously?
- How does the system behave when third-party integrations (Line OA, AI models) are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when users submit queries in languages not supported by the configured AI model?
