# Tasks: Comprehensive Chatbot Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-refer-to-these/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: Next.js 15.0, TypeScript, Shadcn/ui, Neon PostgreSQL, AWS Bedrock
   → Structure: Extend existing app/ directory with new dashboard sections
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: 12 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 4 files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, database, UI framework
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD approach)
   → Core: models, services, API endpoints
   → Integration: vector operations, authentication, monitoring
   → Polish: performance, documentation, deployment
4. Task rules applied:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T042
6. Dependencies validated: setup → tests → implementation → polish
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
- **Setup (T001-T010) blocks everything** - Must complete database setup first
- **Tests (T011-T022) before implementation (T023-T060)** - TDD approach enforced
- **Models (T023-T028) before Services (T029-T033)** - Data layer foundation
- **Services (T029-T033) before API Routes (T034-T039)** - Business logic before endpoints

### Detailed Dependencies
- T023-T028 (models) block T029-T033 (services)
- T029-T033 (services) block T034-T039 (API routes)
- T040-T042 (dashboard infrastructure) block T043-T047 (feature pages)
- T034-T039 (API routes) block T043-T047 (UI pages that consume APIs)
- T001 (Shadcn/ui setup) blocks T040-T050 (all UI components)
- T004-T010 (database migrations) block T023-T028 (models)

## Parallel Execution Examples

Task: "Contract test POST /api/v1/chatbots/{id}/conversations in tests/contract/conversations.spec.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/analytics/overview in tests/contract/analytics.spec.ts"
```

### Launch Model Creation Together (T023-T028):
```
Task: "Organization model in lib/models/organization.ts"
Task: "Product model in lib/models/product.ts"
Task: "Document model in lib/models/document.ts"
Task: "ChatbotInstance model in lib/models/chatbot.ts"
Task: "ConversationSession model in lib/models/conversation.ts"
Task: "Message model in lib/models/message.ts"
```

### Launch UI Components Together (T040-T042):
```
Task: "Dashboard layout component in components/ui/dashboard/layout.tsx"
Task: "Sidebar navigation in components/ui/dashboard/sidebar.tsx"
Task: "Header with user menu in components/ui/dashboard/header.tsx"
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies between them
- **Sequential tasks** = modify same files or have data dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing features (TDD approach)
- **Commit after each task** for clean Git history
- **Non-destructive changes only** - preserve existing AWS Amplify deployment
- **Thai/English support** built in from the start across all components

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 6 contract test tasks [P] (T011-T016)
2. **From Data Model**: 12 entities → 6 model creation tasks [P] (T023-T028)
3. **From User Stories**: 6 integration scenarios → 6 integration tests [P] (T017-T022)
4. **From Endpoints**: 25+ endpoints → 6 API route implementation tasks (T034-T039)
5. **From UI Requirements**: Dashboard system → 13 UI component tasks (T040-T052)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T011-T016)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T023-T028)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Setup tasks (T001-T010) come before everything else
- [x] Integration tests validate end-to-end scenarios from quickstart.md
- [x] Performance requirements (<200ms vector search) explicitly tested (T021, T061)
- [x] Thai/English internationalization covered (T022, T058-T060)
- [x] Non-destructive changes maintained (extends app/ structure, preserves existing files)
