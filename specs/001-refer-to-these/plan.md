## Summary
Transform existing Next.js API testing starter into comprehensive chatbot management system with knowledge base management, multi-instance chatbot creation, Line OA integration, admin feedback system, and analytics dashboard. Built on existing AWS Amplify deployment with Neon PostgreSQL, preserving all current functionality while adding professional dashboard UI using Shadcn/ui components.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3, Next.js 15.0, React 18.2
**Primary Dependencies**: Shadcn/ui, Neon PostgreSQL, AWS Bedrock, Langchain, Stack Auth
**Storage**: Neon PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings, AWS S3 for document storage
**Testing**: Playwright for E2E/visual, Jest for unit tests, existing API integration tests
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive desktop-first with mobile optimization)
**Project Type**: web - extends existing app/ directory with new dashboard sections
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <200ms vector search, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: Preserve AWS Amplify deployment, non-destructive changes only, maintain existing environment variables
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant admin system, 10k+ documents, 1000+ concurrent conversations, Thai/English multilingual

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Documentation-First Development ✅
- All integrations use Context7 MCP for official documentation
- Shadcn/ui components follow official patterns and best practices
- AWS Bedrock, Neon PostgreSQL, and Langchain integrations documented

### Multi-language Excellence ✅
- Thai and English support built-in from start
- UI layouts designed for text expansion/contraction
- Cultural adaptations for Thai market requirements

### Test-Driven Integration ✅
- Extends existing API testing framework
- Playwright visual regression tests for new components
- Contract tests for all new API endpoints
- Isolated service testing before UI integration

### Best Practices Enforcement ✅
- TypeScript strict mode maintained
- ESLint/Prettier configuration preserved
- Error handling patterns consistent with existing code
- GitHub workflow integration maintained

### Performance & Observability ✅
- Existing Sentry integration extended
- AWS cost optimization strategies implemented
- Vector database performance monitoring
- Existing monitoring patterns preserved

**RESULT**: All constitutional requirements satisfied

**Structure Decision**: Extend existing Next.js app structure - preserve all current functionality while adding new dashboard sections

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
*Completed - see research.md for full details*

### Research Tasks Completed:
1. **Shadcn/ui Integration Patterns** → Professional dashboard design system
2. **Neon PostgreSQL Vector Extensions** → pgvector configuration and optimization
3. **AWS Bedrock Multi-Model Support** → Cost-effective model selection strategies
4. **Langchain RAG Implementation** → TypeScript integration patterns
5. **Thai Language Support** → Font rendering and text processing requirements
6. **Document Processing Pipeline** → OCR and chunking strategies
7. **Real-time Updates** → WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events comparison

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented and justified

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Completed - see data-model.md and contracts/ for full details*

### Generated Artifacts:

1. **Database Schema** (`data-model.md`):
   - Products, Documents, ContentChunks (knowledge base)
   - ChatbotInstances, Conversations, Messages (chatbot management)
   - Users, Integrations, Feedback (admin management)
   - Vector embeddings and search optimization

2. **API Contracts** (`contracts/`):
   - Knowledge Base API (upload, process, search)
   - Chatbot Management API (CRUD, configuration)
   - Conversation API (sessions, messages, history)
   - Analytics API (metrics, reports, monitoring)

3. **Contract Tests**:
   - Generated failing tests for all endpoints
   - Request/response schema validation
   - Error handling test scenarios

4. **Integration Scenarios** (`quickstart.md`):
   - End-to-end user workflows
   - Development setup instructions
   - Testing validation steps

5. **Agent Context** (`CLAUDE.md`):
   - Updated with new chatbot management capabilities
   - Added document processing workflows
   - Extended with vector database operations

**Output**: Complete design documentation and contract definitions

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load Phase 1 design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/)
- Generate database migration tasks for each entity
- Create API endpoint implementation tasks from contracts
- Generate UI component tasks for each dashboard section
- Create integration test tasks for user scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Database migrations first (establish foundation)
- API endpoints in dependency order (models → services → routes)
- UI components in parallel where possible
- Integration tests after implementation complete
- Performance optimization and monitoring setup

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- 8 database migration tasks
- 15 API endpoint implementation tasks
- 12 UI component creation tasks
- 5 integration and testing tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (systematic execution of tasks.md)
**Phase 5**: Validation (testing, performance verification, deployment)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations found - this section intentionally left empty*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
