## Database Schema Standards

### Vector Table Design
```sql
-- Standard vector table structure
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES content(id),
    vector_data vector(1536) NOT NULL, -- OpenAI ada-002 dimensions
    chunk_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Optimized indexes for vector operations
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_embeddings_vector_cosine
ON embeddings USING ivfflat (vector_data vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_embeddings_content_chunk
ON embeddings (content_id, chunk_index);
```

### Migration Framework
```sql
-- Migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    version VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    rollback_sql TEXT,
    description TEXT
);

-- Performance monitoring table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS query_performance (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    execution_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rows_examined INTEGER,
    rows_returned INTEGER,
    executed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

SELECT
    idx_name,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
